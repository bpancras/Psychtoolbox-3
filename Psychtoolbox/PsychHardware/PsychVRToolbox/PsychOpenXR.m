% PsychOpenXR - A high level driver for OpenXR supported XR hardware.
%
% Copyright (c) 2022 Mario Kleiner. Licensed to you under the MIT license.
% Our underlying PsychOpenXRCore mex driver builds against the Khronos OpenXR SDK public
% headers, and links against the OpenXR open-source dynamic loader, to implement the
% interface to a system-installed OpenXR runtime. These components are dual-licensed by
% Khronos under Apache 2.0 and MIT license: SPDX license identifier "Apache-2.0 OR MIT"
%
% Note: If you want to write VR code that is portable across
% VR headsets of different vendors, then use the PsychVRHMD()
% driver instead of this driver. The PsychVRHMD driver will use
% this driver as appropriate when connecting to a OpenXR supported XR device,
% but it will also automatically work
% with other head mounted displays. This driver does however
% expose a few functions specific to OpenXR hardware, so you can
% mix calls to this driver with calls to PsychVRHMD to do some
% mix & match.
%
% For setup instructions for OpenXR, see "help OpenXR". TODO
%
%
% Usage:
%
% oldverbosity = PsychOpenXR('Verbosity' [, newverbosity]);
% - Get/Set level of verbosity for driver status messages, warning messages,
% error messages etc. 'newverbosity' is the optional new verbosity level,
% 'oldverbosity' is the currently set verbosity level - ie. before changing
% it.  Valid settings are: 0 = Silent, 1 = Errors only, 2 = Warnings, 3 = Info,
% 4 = Debug.
%
%
% hmd = PsychOpenXR('AutoSetupHMD' [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, deviceIndex]);
% - Open a OpenXR HMD, set it up with good default rendering and
% display parameters and generate a PsychImaging('AddTask', ...)
% line to setup the Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline for proper display
% on the HMD. This will also cause the device connection to get
% auto-closed as soon as the onscreen window which displays on
% the HMD is closed. Returns the 'hmd' handle of the HMD on success.
%
% By default, the first detected HMD will be used and if no VR HMD
% is connected, it will return an empty [] hmd handle. You can override
% this default choice of HMD by specifying the optional 'deviceIndex'
% parameter to choose a specific HMD. However, only one HMD per machine is
% supported, so the 'deviceIndex' will probably be only useful in the future.
%
% More optional parameters: 'basicTask' what kind of task should be implemented.
% The default is 'Tracked3DVR', which means to setup for stereoscopic 3D
% rendering, driven by head motion tracking, for a fully immersive experience
% in some kind of 3D virtual world. This is the default if omitted. The task
% 'Stereoscopic' sets up for display of stereoscopic stimuli, but without
% head tracking. 'Monoscopic' sets up for display of monocular stimuli, ie.
% the HMD is just used as a special kind of standard display monitor. In 'Monoscopic'
% and 'Stereoscopic' mode, both eyes will be presented with an identical field of view,
% to make sure pure 2D drawing works, without the need for setup of special per-eye
% projection transformations. In 'Tracked3DVR' mode, each eye will have a different
% field of view, optimized to maximize the viewable area while still avoiding occlusion
% artifacts due to the nose of the wearer of the HMD.
%
% 'basicRequirements' defines basic requirements for the task. Currently
% defined are the following strings which can be combined into a single
% 'basicRequirements' string:
%
% 'Float16Display' = Request rendering, compositing and display in 16 bpc float
% format. This will ask Psychtoolbox to render and post-process stimuli in 16 bpc
% linear floating point format, and allocate 16 bpc half-float textures as final
% renderbuffers to be sent to the VR compositor. If the VR compositor takes advantage
% of the high source image precision is at the discretion of the compositor and HMD.
% By default, if this request is omitted, processing and display in sRGB format is
% requested from Psychtoolbox and the compositor, ie., a roughly gamma 2.2 8 bpc
% format is used.
%
% 'PerEyeFOV' = Request use of per eye individual and asymmetric fields of view even
% when the 'basicTask' was selected to be 'Monoscopic' or 'Stereoscopic'. This allows
% for wider field of view in these tasks, but requires the usercode to adapt to these
% different and asymmetric fields of view for each eye, e.g., by selecting proper 3D
% projection matrices for each eye.
%
% 'TimingSupport' = Support some hardware specific means of timestamping
% or latency measurements. On the Rift DK1 this does nothing. On the DK2
% it enables dynamic prediction and timing measurements with the Rifts internal
% latency tester.
%
% 'basicQuality' defines the basic tradeoff between quality and required
% computational power. A setting of 0 gives lowest quality, but with the
% lowest performance requirements. A setting of 1 gives maximum quality at
% maximum computational load. Values between 0 and 1 change the quality to
% performance tradeoff.
%
%
% hmd = PsychOpenXR('Open' [, deviceIndex], ...);
% - Open HMD with index 'deviceIndex'. See PsychOpenXRCore Open?
% for help on additional parameters.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('SetAutoClose', hmd, mode);
% - Set autoclose mode for HMD with handle 'hmd'. 'mode' can be
% 0 (this is the default) to not do anything special. 1 will close
% the HMD 'hmd' when the onscreen window is closed which displays
% on the HMD. 2 will do the same as 1, but close all open HMDs and
% shutdown the complete driver and OpenXR runtime - a full cleanup.
%
%
% isOpen = PsychOpenXR('IsOpen', hmd);
% - Returns 1 if 'hmd' corresponds to an open HMD, 0 otherwise.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('Close' [, hmd]);
% - Close provided HMD device 'hmd'. If no 'hmd' handle is provided,
% all HMDs will be closed and the driver will be shutdown.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('Controllers', hmd);
% - Return a bitmask of all connected controllers: Can be the bitand
% of the OVR.ControllerType_XXX flags described in 'GetInputState'.
% This does not detect if controllers are hot-plugged or unplugged after
% the HMD was opened. Iow. only probed at 'Open'.
%
%
% info = PsychOpenXR('GetInfo', hmd);
% - Retrieve a struct 'info' with information about the HMD 'hmd'.
% The returned info struct contains at least the following standardized
% fields with information:
%
% handle = Driver internal handle for the specific HMD.
% driver = Function handle to the actual driver for the HMD, e.g., @PsychOpenXR.
% type   = Defines the type/vendor of the device, e.g., 'OpenXR'.
% modelName = Name string with the name of the model of the device, e.g., 'Rift DK2'.
% separateEyePosesSupported = 1 if use of PsychOpenXR('GetEyePose') will improve
%                             the quality of the VR experience, 0 if no improvement
%                             is to be expected, so 'GetEyePose' can be avoided
%                             to save processing time without a loss of quality.
%                             This always returns 1 for at least the Rift DK1 and DK2,
%                             as use of that function can enhance the quality of the
%                             VR experience with fast head movements.
%
% The returned struct may contain more information, but the fields mentioned
% above are the only ones guaranteed to be available over the long run. Other
% fields may disappear or change their format and meaning anytime without
% warning.
%
%
% isSupported = PsychOpenXR('Supported');
% - Returns 1 if the OpenXR driver is functional, 0 otherwise. The
% driver is functional if the VR runtime library was successfully
% initialized and a connection to the VR server process has been
% established. It would return 0 if the server process would not be
% running, or if the required runtime library would not be correctly
% installed.
%
%
% [isVisible, playAreaBounds, OuterAreaBounds] = PsychOpenXR('VRAreaBoundary', hmd [, requestVisible]);
% - Request visualization of the VR play area boundary for 'hmd' and returns its
% current extents.
%
% 'requestVisible' 1 = Request showing the boundary area markers, 0 = Don't
% request showing the markers.
% The driver can not prevent the boundaries to be visualized if some external
% setting asks for their visibility. It can cancel its own request for visibility
% though via 'requestVisible' setting 0.
%
% Returns in 'isVisible' the current visibility status of the VR area boundaries.
%
% 'playAreaBounds' is a 3-by-n matrix defining the play area boundaries. Each
% column represents the [x;y;z] coordinates of one 3D definition point. Connecting
% successive points by line segments defines the boundary, as projected onto the
% floor. Points are listed in clock-wise direction. An empty return argument means
% that the play area is so far undefined.
%
% 'OuterAreaBounds' defines the outer area boundaries in the same way as
% 'playAreaBounds'.
%
%
% [isTriggering, closestDistance, closestPointxyz, surfaceNormal] = PsychOpenXR('TestVRBoundary', hmd, trackedDeviceType, boundaryType);
% - Return if a tracked device of type 'trackedDeviceType' and associated with 'hmd' is
% colliding with VR area boundaries of 'boundaryType'. This needs the requested devices
% to be online, and the boundaries set up properly, in order to provide meaningful results.
%
% 'trackedDeviceType' is a bit-mask (sum) of the following possible constants:
% OVR.TrackedDevice_HMD = The HMD headset itself,
% OVR.TrackedDevice_LTouch = Left touch controller / left hand.
% OVR.TrackedDevice_RTouch = Right touch controller / right hand.
% OVR.TrackedDevice_Touch = Any/Both of left and right touch controllers.
% OVR.TrackedDevice_Object0 - OVR.TrackedDevice_Object3 = Tracked objects 0 - 3.
% OVR.TrackedDevice_All = All connected tracked devices.
%
% 'boundaryType' 0 = Play area, 1 = Outer boundary.
%
% Return values:
% 'isTriggering' 1 if collision is imminent, 0 otherwise.
% 'closestDistance' Distance to closest point on boundary.
% 'closestPointxyz' [x;y;z] 3D position of closest point on the boundary.
% 'surfaceNormal' [nx;ny;nz] 3D surface normal of closest point.
%
%
% [isTriggering, closestDistance, closestPointxyz, surfaceNormal] = PsychOpenXR('TestVRBoundaryPoint', hmd, pointxyz, boundaryType);
% - Return if a 3D point 'pointxyz' is colliding with VR area boundaries of 'boundaryType'
% on device 'hmd'. This needs the boundaries set up properly, in order to provide meaningful
% results.
%
% 'pointxyz' = [x,y,z] 3D point position vector.
% 'boundaryType' 0 = Play area, 1 = Outer boundary.
%
% 'isTriggering' 1 if 'pointxyz' is colliding / close, 0 otherwise.
% 'closestDistance' Distance to closest point on boundary.
% 'closestPointxyz' [x;y;z] 3D position of closest point on the boundary.
% 'surfaceNormal' [nx;ny;nz] 3D surface normal of closest point.
%
%
% input = PsychOpenXR('GetInputState', hmd, controllerType);
% - Get input state of controller 'controllerType' associated with HMD 'hmd'.
%
% 'controllerType' can be one of OVR.ControllerType_LTouch, OVR.ControllerType_RTouch,
% OVR.ControllerType_Touch, OVR.ControllerType_Remote, OVR.ControllerType_XBox, or
% OVR.ControllerType_Active for selecting whatever controller is currently active.
%
% Return argument 'input' is a struct with fields describing the state of buttons and
% other input elements of the specified 'controllerType'. It has the following fields:
%
% 'Valid' = 1 if 'input' contains valid results, 0 if input status is invalid/unavailable.
% 'Time' Time of last input state change of controller.
% 'Buttons' Vector with button state on the controller, similar to the 'keyCode'
% vector returned by KbCheck() for regular keyboards. Each position in the vector
% reports pressed (1) or released (0) state of a specific button. Use the OVR.Button_XXX
% constants to map buttons to positions.
%
% 'Touches' Like 'Buttons' but for touch buttons. Use the OVR.Touch_XXX constants to map
% touch points to positions.
%
% 'Trigger'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) trigger: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered and with dead-zone.
% 'TriggerNoDeadzone'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) trigger: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered.
% 'TriggerRaw'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) trigger: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, raw values unfiltered.
% 'Grip'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) grip button: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered and with dead-zone.
% 'GripNoDeadzone'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) grip button: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered.
% 'GripRaw'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) grip button: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, raw values unfiltered.
%
% 'Thumbstick' = 2x2 matrix: Column 1 contains left thumbsticks [x;y] axis values, column 2 contains
%  right sticks [x;y] axis values. Values are in range -1 to +1, filtered and with deadzone applied.
% 'ThumbstickNoDeadzone' = Like 'Thumbstick', filtered, but without a deadzone applied.
% 'ThumbstickRaw' = 'Thumbstick' raw date without deadzone or filtering applied.
%
%
% pulseEndTime = PsychOpenXR('HapticPulse', hmd, controllerType [, duration=2.5][, freq=1.0][, amplitude=1.0]);
% - Trigger a haptic feedback pulse, some controller vibration, on the specified 'controllerType'
% associated with the specified 'hmd'. 'duration' is pulse duration in seconds, by default a maximum
% of 2.5 seconds is executed. 'freq' is normalized frequency in range 0.0 - 1.0. A value of 0 will
% disable an ongoing pulse. As of OpenXR 1, only freq values 0.5 and 1.0 are
% reproduced. Other freq values will be clamped/quantized to those values. 'amplitude' is the
% amplitude of the vibration in normalized 0.0 - 1.0 range.
%
% 'pulseEndTime' returns the expected stop time of vibration in seconds, given the parameters.
% Currently the function will return immediately for a (default) 'duration' of 2.5 seconds, and the pulse
% will end after 2.5 seconds. Smaller 'duration' values will block the execution of the function
% until the 'duration' has passed on some types of controllers.
%
%
% state = PsychOpenXR('PrepareRender', hmd [, userTransformMatrix][, reqmask=1][, targetTime]);
% - Mark the start of the rendering cycle for a new 3D rendered stereoframe.
% Return a struct 'state' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of a scene, based on head tracking data.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the HMD which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'reqmask' defines what kind of information is requested to be returned in
% struct 'state'. Only query information you actually need, as computing some
% of this info is expensive! See below for supported values for 'reqmask'.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results,
% e.g., the midpoint of scanout of the next video frame.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
%
% state always contains a field state.tracked, whose bits signal the status
% of head tracking for this frame. A +1 flag means that head orientation is
% tracked. A +2 flag means that head position is tracked via some absolute
% position tracker like, e.g., the Oculus Rift DK2 or Rift CV1 camera. A +128
% flag means the HMD is actually strapped onto the subjects head and displaying
% our visual content. Lack of this flag means the HMD is off and thereby blanked
% and dark, or we lost access to it to another application.
%
% state also always contains a field state.SessionState, whose bits signal general
% VR session status:
% +1  = Our rendering goes to the HMD, ie. we have control over it. Lack of this could
%       mean the Health and Safety warning is displaying at the moment and waiting for
%       acknowledgement, or the OpenXR GUI application is in control.
% +2  = HMD is present and active.
% +4  = HMD is strapped onto users head. A Rift CV1 would switch off/blank if not on the head.
% +8  = DisplayLost condition! Some hardware/software malfunction, need to completely quit this
%       Psychtoolbox session to recover from this.
% +16 = ShouldQuit The user interface / user asks us to voluntarily terminate this session.
% +32 = ShouldRecenter = The user interface asks us to recenter/recalibrate our tracking origin.
%
% 'reqmask' defaults to 1 and can have the following values added together:
%
% +1 = Return matrices for left and right "eye cameras" which can be directly
%      used as OpenGL GL_MODELVIEW matrices for rendering the scene. 4x4 matrices
%      for left- and right eye are contained in state.modelView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Return position and orientation 4x4 camera view matrices which describe
%      position and orientation of the "eye cameras" relative to the world
%      reference frame. They are the inverses of state.modelView{}. These
%      matrices can be directly used to define cameras for rendering of complex
%      3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine. Left- and right eye matrices are
%      contained in state.cameraView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Additionally tracked/predicted head pose is returned in state.localHeadPoseMatrix
%      and the global head pose after application of the 'userTransformMatrix' is
%      returned in state.globalHeadPoseMatrix - this is the basis for computing
%      the camera transformation matrices.
%
% +2 = Return matrices for tracked left and right hands of user, ie. of tracked positions
%      and orientations of left and right XR input controllers, if any.
%
%      state.handStatus(1) = Tracking status of left hand: 0 = Untracked, 1 = Orientation
%                            tracked, 2 = Position tracked, 3 = Orientation and position
%                            tracked. If handStatus is == 0 then all the following information
%                            is invalid and can not be used in any meaningful way.
%      state.handStatus(2) = Tracking status of right hand.
%
%      state.localHandPoseMatrix{1} = 4x4 OpenGL right handed reference frame matrix with
%                                     hand position and orientation encoded to define a
%                                     proper GL_MODELVIEW transform for rendering stuff
%                                     "into"/"relative to" the oriented left hand.
%      state.localHandPoseMatrix{2} = Ditto for the right hand.
%
%      state.globalHandPoseMatrix{1} = userTransformMatrix * state.localHandPoseMatrix{1};
%                                      Left hand pose transformed by passed in userTransformMatrix.
%      state.globalHandPoseMatrix{2} = Ditto for the right hand.
%
%      state.globalHandPoseInverseMatrix{1} = Inverse of globalHandPoseMatrix{1} for collision
%                                             testing/grasping of virtual objects relative to
%                                             hand pose of left hand.
%      state.globalHandPoseInverseMatrix{2} = Ditto for right hand.
%
% More flags to follow...
%
%
% eyePose = PsychOpenXR('GetEyePose', hmd, renderPass [, userTransformMatrix][, targetTime]);
% - Return a struct 'eyePose' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of the stereo view of one eye, based on head
% tracking data. This function provides essentially the same information as
% the 'PrepareRender' function, but only for one eye. Therefore you will need
% to call this function twice, once for each of the two renderpasses, at the
% beginning of each renderpass.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the HMD which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'renderPass' defines if information should be returned for the 1st renderpass
% (renderPass == 0) or for the 2nd renderpass (renderPass == 1). The driver will
% decide for you if the 1st renderpass should render the left eye and the 2nd
% pass the right eye, or if the 1st renderpass should render the right eye and
% then the 2nd renderpass the left eye. The ordering depends on the properties
% of the video display of your HMD, specifically on the video scanout order:
% Is it right to left, left to right, or top to bottom? For each scanout order
% there is an optimal order for the renderpasses to minimize perceived lag.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
% Return values in struct 'eyePose':
%
% 'eyeIndex' The eye for which this information applies. 0 = Left eye, 1 = Right eye.
%            You can pass 'eyeIndex' into the Screen('SelectStereoDrawBuffer', win, eyeIndex)
%            to select the proper eye target render buffer.
%
% 'modelView' is a 4x4 RHS OpenGL matrix which can be directly used as OpenGL
%             GL_MODELVIEW matrix for rendering the scene.
%
% 'cameraView' contains a 4x4 RHS camera matrix which describes position and
%              orientation of the "eye camera" relative to the world reference
%              frame. It is the inverse of eyePose.modelView. This matrix can
%              be directly used to define the camera for rendering of complex
%              3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine or other engines which want
%              absolute camera pose instead of the inverse matrix.
%
% Additionally tracked/predicted head pose is returned in eyePose.localHeadPoseMatrix
% and the global head pose after application of the 'userTransformMatrix' is
% returned in eyePose.globalHeadPoseMatrix - this is the basis for computing
% the camera transformation matrix.
%
%
% trackers = PsychOpenXR('GetTrackersState', hmd);
% - Return a struct array with infos about all connected tracking cameras/sensors
% for 'hmd'.
%
%
% success = PsychOpenXR('RecenterTrackingOrigin', hmd);
% - Recenter the tracking origin for the 'hmd', based on its current position and
% orientation. Returns 'success' = 1 on success, 0 on failure to recenter. One
% reason for failure could be that the HMD wasn't roughly level, but instead was
% facing upward or downward, which is not allowed. This function also gets automatically
% triggered if the OpenXR GUI or other user input requests a recenter. Recenter would then
% be auto-triggered during a call to 'PrepareRender'.
%
%
% oldType = PsychOpenXR('TrackingOriginType', hmd [, newType]);
% - Specify the type of tracking origin for OpenXR device 'hmd'.
% This returns the current type of tracking origin in 'oldType'.
% Optionally you can specify a new tracking origin type as 'newType'.
% Type must be either:
% 0 = Origin is at eye height (HMD height).
% 1 = Origin is at floor height.
% The eye height or floor height gets defined by the system during
% calls to 'RecenterTrackingOrigin' and during sensor calibration in
% the OpenXR GUI application.
%
%
% [adaptiveGpuPerformanceScale, frameStats, anyFrameStatsDropped, aswIsAvailable] = PsychOpenXR('GetPerformanceStats', hmd);
% - Return global and per-frame performance statistics for the given 'hmd'.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('SetupRenderingParameters', hmd [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, fov=[HMDRecommended]][, pixelsPerDisplay=1])
% - Query the HMD 'hmd' for its properties and setup internal rendering
% parameters in preparation for opening an onscreen window with PsychImaging
% to display properly on the HMD. See section about 'AutoSetupHMD' above for
% the meaning of the optional parameters 'basicTask', 'basicRequirements'
% and 'basicQuality'.
%
% 'fov' Optional field of view in degrees, from line of sight: [leftdeg, rightdeg,
% updeg, downdeg]. If 'fov' is omitted, the HMD runtime will be asked for a
% good default field of view and that will be used. The field of view may be
% dependent on the settings in the HMD user profile of the currently selected
% user.
%
% 'pixelsPerDisplay' Ratio of the number of render target pixels to display pixels
% at the center of distortion. Defaults to 1.0 if omitted. Lower values can
% improve performance, at lower quality.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('SetBasicQuality', hmd, basicQuality);
% - Set basic level of quality vs. required GPU performance.
%
%
% oldValues = PsychOpenXR('FloatsProperty', hmd, property [, newValues]);
% - Get current values 'oldValues' and optionally set new values 'newValues'
% for a floating point array property with name 'property' on 'hmd'.
%
% 'property' name strings are defined under OVR.KEY_XXX. As of SDK version 1.11,
% the following floats properties exist:
% OVR.KEY_PLAYER_HEIGHT = [Height] of subject in meters.
% OVR.KEY_EYE_HEIGHT = [Height] of eyes of subject above ground in meters.
% OVR.KEY_NECK_TO_EYE_DISTANCE = [horizontal, vertical] neck to eye distance in meters.
% OVR.KEY_EYE_TO_NOSE_DISTANCE = [horizontal, vertical] eye to nose distance in meters.
%
%
% oldString = PsychOpenXR('StringProperty', hmd, property [, defaultString][, newString]);
% - Get current string 'oldString' and optionally set new string 'newString'
% for a string property with name 'property' on 'hmd'. If the property does not

  % Need to call the PsychOpenXR(1) callback at each Screen('Flip') to submit the
  % output frames to the VR-Compositor for presentation on the HMD asap. This gets
  % called immediately before an OpenGL bufferswap (if any) + timestamping + validation
  % will happen, iow. at t >= tWhen for Screen('Flip', win, tWhen);
  % It is supposed to block until image presentation on the HMD has happened, and to
  % inject proper Present timestamps for 'Flip':
  % TODO FIXME: Nope, change of strategy: We set the kPsychSkipWaitForFlipOnce flag in
  % 'EndFrameRender', so PreSwapbuffersOperations does not wait until tWhen, but executes
  % immediately. We pass in the tWhen timestamp to this fast-path callback, which will pass
  % it on to 'PresentFrame', and then it is the job of the PsychOpenXRCore drivers thread
  % to wait until the right moment to submit the new frame to the VR compositor. This allows
  % to use a single-threaded presentation model, where the single thread busy-waits until the
  % right point in time. We retain the ability to 'Flip' as fast as possible for closed-loop
  % tracked VR presentation, and the ability to do timed open-loop presentation with 'tWhen'
  % target times, and avoid all the multi-threading misery the OpenXR runtime brings to us.
  % Downside is the inability to avoid the sandclock warning if usercode truly does not execute
  % any Flip's for more than a second, but this has to do as a stepping stone for now:
